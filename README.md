# Welcome to GameBoa!
What follows is a documentation for the GameBoa project.

## What is this project?
It is a Python-based Game Boy emulator with a nice GUI on top.

## What is the current state of the project?
Currently, it's a mess. Me and PedanticHacker are still working on many
of the hardware intrinsics, all the memory mappings, the GUI, etc.

## What are the plans for the project?
First and foremost, we want to develop a functional, performant Game Boy
emulator, supporting all of its editions, such as the Game Boy Classic,
the Game Boy Color, and the Game Boy Advance.

## How can I help?
Feel free to submit issue reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
Me and PedanticHacker are relatively new to this, so any expert help is
greatly appreciated.

If you have any experience with Game Boy emulation, don't be shy to
reach out to us, we'd love to hear from you and consider your ideas
about this project.
