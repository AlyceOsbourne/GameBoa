# Welcome to GameBoa!
What follows is a documentation for the GameBoa project.

## What is it?
This is a Python-based Game Boy emulator with some superior features.

## What is the current state of the project?
Currently, it's a mess. PedanticHacker and I are still working on many
of the hardware intrinsics, memory mappings, etc.

## What are the plans for the project?
First and foremost, a functional, performant gameboy emulator, supporting the main classic editions such as the Classic, the Color and the Advanced.

Once these have been implemented to a good degree, these are the following features we'd like to get implemented:
- In Memory IPS patching, no more having a separate rom for each patch, when adding a patch you will be able to select what roms are compatible with it
- Web based link cable support, allowing you to play with your friends over the internet, we are hoping to ustilize the in memory patching to allow for this
- Neural Network interfacing, to allow you to use gamebout games as a training gym for your neural network, and to allow you to play games using your neural network
- Debugging tools for gameboy game and romhack development

## How can I help?
Feel free to submit issue reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
Me and PedanticHacker are relatively new to this, so any expert help is appreciated.

If you have any experience with Game Boy emulation, don't be shy to
reach out to us, we'd love to hear from you and get your ideas about
this project.
