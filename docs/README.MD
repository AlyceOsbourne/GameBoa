# Welcome to GameBoa the Python GameBoy Emulator


### What is GameBoa?
___

GameBoa is my friend, and I's attempt at putting together a python based emulator with some different and interesting features

### What is the current state of the project?
___
Currently, it's a mess, we are still working on many of the intrinsics of the hardware, mapping etc etc.


### What are the plans for the project?
___
First and foremost, a functional, performant gameboy emulator, supporting the main classic editions such as the Classic, the Color and the Advanced.

Once these have been implemented to a good degree, these are the following features we'd like to get implemented:
- In Memory IPS patching, no more having a separate rom for each patch, when adding a patch you will be able to select what roms are compatible with it
- Web based link cable support, allowing you to play with your friends over the internet, we are hoping to ustilize the in memory patching to allow for this
- Neural Network interfacing, to allow you to use gamebout games as a training gym for your neural network, and to allow you to play games using your neural network
- Debugging tools for gameboy game and romhack development

### How can I help?
___
Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or even pull requests, we are relatively new to this so any help is appreciated
If you have experience with gameboy emulation, feel free to reach out to us, we'd love to hear from you and get your input on the project
